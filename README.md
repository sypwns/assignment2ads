# Custom Java Data Structures

This project provides custom implementations of core data structures in Java: MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap. Each structure supports common operations like add, remove, get, push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, insert, and extractMin.

##  Implemented Classes

### Physical Structures:
MyArrayList: A dynamic array
MyLinkedList: A doubly linked list

### Logical Structures:
MyStack: Stack based on MyArrayList
MyQueue: Queue based on MyLinkedList
MyMinHeap: Min heap based on MyArrayList
